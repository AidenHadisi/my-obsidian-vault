## Highlights
Why do the wicked live on, reach old age, and grow mighty in power? — location: [505](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=505) ^ref-24245

---
God harshly rebukes the three comforters for their lack of wisdom, ignores the young comforter entirely, and then confronts Job — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=524) ^ref-52912

---
God as still in sovereign control but governing the world by a wisdom that resists formulaic description. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=548) ^ref-35243

---
The tiger only tears and gnaws, that’s all he can do. He would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he were able to do it. — location: [789](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=789) ^ref-11388

---
all I know is that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; — location: [900](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=900) ^ref-32289

---
Surely I haven’t suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the soil of the future harmony for somebody else. — location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=905) ^ref-12227

---
What do I care for a hell for oppressors? — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=925) ^ref-54220

---
And what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don’t want more suffering. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=925) ^ref-46298

---
too high a price is asked for harmony; it’s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. — location: [933](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=933) ^ref-52263

---
good cannot be the cause of evil. For — location: [952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=952) ^ref-54316

---
one contrary cannot be the cause of another. But evil is the contrary to good. Therefore good cannot be the cause of evil. — location: [953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=953) ^ref-9520

---
evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing. — location: [960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=960) ^ref-36420

---
Evil, however, has a cause by way of an agent, not directly, but accidentally. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=967) ^ref-33215

---
Evil has a deficient cause in voluntary things otherwise than in natural things. — location: [988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=988) ^ref-1293

---
This defect, however, is not a fault, but fault follows upon it from the fact that the will acts with this defect. — location: [992](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=992) ^ref-29979

---
God is the author of the evil which is penalty, but not of the evil which is fault, by reason of what is said above. — location: [1014](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1014) ^ref-35374

---
although evil always lessens good, yet it never wholly consumes it; and thus, while good ever remains, nothing can be wholly and perfectly bad. — location: [1046](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1046) ^ref-36749

---
if the wholly evil could be, it would destroy itself; because all good being destroyed (which it need be for something to be wholly evil), evil itself would be taken away, since its subject is good. — location: [1048](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1048) ^ref-63091

---
in every species the defect of nature is in the smaller number. — location: [1075](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1075) ^ref-49424

---
more men seek good in regard to the senses than good according to reason. — location: [1076](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1076) ^ref-63894

---
Whoever does not choose the best is lacking in power, or in knowledge, or in goodness. — location: [1085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1085) ^ref-43324

---
that an imperfection in the part may be required for a greater perfection in the whole. — location: [1099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1099) ^ref-9192

---
was in accordance with order and the general good that God allowed to certain creatures the opportunity of exercising their liberty, even when he foresaw that they would turn to evil, but which he could so well rectify; — location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1104) ^ref-50949

---
sufficient to show that a world with evil might be better than a world without evil; — location: [1106](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1106) ^ref-15634

---
If it is always impossible not to sin, it is always unjust to punish. — location: [1109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1109) ^ref-21838

---
if it is certain that we shall perform them, it is not less certain that we shall choose to perform them. — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1129) ^ref-43789

---
it is possible that one could prevent sin, but ought not, because he could not do it without himself committing a sin, or (when God is in question) without performing an unreasonable action. — location: [1153](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1153) ^ref-51629

---
The reasons of this connection, by means of which one is placed in more favorable circumstances than another, are hidden in the depths of the wisdom of God; they depend upon the universal harmony. — location: [1201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1201) ^ref-29131

---
There is nothing less servile, and nothing more in accordance with the highest degree of freedom, than to be always led toward the good, and always by one’s own inclination, without any constraint and without any displeasure. — location: [1211](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=1211) ^ref-51891

---
the flaw of wickedness is not nature, but contrary to nature, and has its origin, not in the Creator, but in the will — location: [4468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4468) ^ref-44336

---
Vice, too, is so contrary to nature that it cannot but damage it. And therefore departure from God would be no vice, unless in a nature whose property it was to abide with God. — location: [4471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4471) ^ref-8347

---
devil (good by God’s creation, wicked by his own will) — location: [4474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4474) ^ref-29672

---
even while God in His goodness created him good, He yet had already foreseen and arranged how He would make use of him when he became wicked. — location: [4478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4478) ^ref-39324

---
He is not discovering, but teaching that it is good. — location: [4498](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4498) ^ref-20676

---
therefore He saw that what He had made was good, when He saw that it was good to make it. — location: [4510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4510) ^ref-46409

---
That the enemies of God are so, not by nature, but by will, which, as it injures them, injures a good nature; for if vice does not injure, it is not vice — location: [4551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4551) ^ref-19956

---
For were they not good, vices could not hurt them. — location: [4560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4560) ^ref-54061

---
though vice cannot injure the unchangeable good, it can injure nothing but good; because it does not exist where it does not injure. — location: [4562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4562) ^ref-1144

---
There is no nature that is evil, even the devil’s. Evil is due to will, not to nature — location: [4584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4584) ^ref-52731

---
All evil can be accounted for in terms of the misuse of free will — location: [4584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4584) ^ref-8051

---
God even permits baptized infants, who are unsurpassed in innocence, to be tormented, in order to teach us to bewail the calamities of this life and desire the life to come — location: [4600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4600) ^ref-44215

---
Augustine’s entire theodicy hinges on this argument. If he cannot consistently claim that all people (except the God-man, of course) deserve eternal punishment, his theodicy fails. — location: [4640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4640) ^ref-3688

---
unless sin is voluntary, it would not be sin — location: [4655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4655) ^ref-37466

---
In order to account for evil, then, Augustine distinguished between the created “nature,” which all beings have, and the “will,” which free beings have. The — location: [4661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01EV6KADU&location=4661) ^ref-7981
