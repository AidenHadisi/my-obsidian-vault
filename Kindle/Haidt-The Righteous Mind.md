## Highlights
rationalist to describe anyone who believes that reasoning is the most important and reliable way to obtain moral knowledge.8 — location: [231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=231) ^ref-17149

---
Young children judged right and wrong by very superficial features, such as whether a person was punished for an action. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=240) ^ref-55966

---
After puberty, right when Piaget said that children become capable of abstract thought, Kohlberg found that some children begin to think for themselves about the nature of authority, the meaning of justice, and the reasons behind rules and laws. — location: [248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=248) ^ref-35969

---
most morally advanced kids (according to his scoring technique) were those who had frequent opportunities for role taking—for putting themselves into another person’s shoes and looking at a problem from that person’s perspective. — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=259) ^ref-21404

---
It’s really hard for a child to see things from the teacher’s point of view, because the child has never been a teacher. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=262) ^ref-4445

---
Piaget and Kohlberg both thought that parents and other authorities were obstacles to moral development. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=263) ^ref-6024

---
if you want your kids to learn about the social world, let them play with other kids and resolve disputes; don’t lecture them about the Ten Commandments. And, for heaven’s sake, don’t force them to obey God or their teachers or you. That will only freeze them at the conventional level. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=265) ^ref-54649

---
it was inevitable that the research would support worldviews that were secular, questioning, and egalitarian. — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=272) ^ref-27732

---
Turiel discovered that children as young as five usually say that the boy was wrong to break the rule, but that it would be OK if the teacher gave permission or if it happened in another school where there was no such rule. — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=282) ^ref-61820

---
Children recognize that rules about clothing, food, and many other aspects of life are social conventions, which are arbitrary and changeable to some extent.12 — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=284) ^ref-54151

---
Children recognize that rules that prevent harm are moral rules, which Turiel defined as rules related to “justice, rights, and welfare pertaining to how people ought to relate to each other.”13 — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=288) ^ref-21698

---
They seem to grasp early on that rules that prevent harm are special, important, unalterable, and universal. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=292) ^ref-64515

---
Children construct their moral understanding on the bedrock of the absolute moral truth that harm is wrong. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=293) ^ref-36434

---
in all of the cultures Turiel examined, children still made a distinction between moral rules and conventional rules.14 — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=294) ^ref-52535

---
That was my first hint that groups create supernatural beings not to explain the universe but to order their societies.18 — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=316) ^ref-30025

---
This was my first hint that morality often involves tension within the group linked to competition between different groups. — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=323) ^ref-10076

---
Turiel would call these rules social conventions, because the Hua don’t believe that men in other tribes have to follow these rules. But the Hua certainly seemed to think of their food rules as moral rules. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=332) ^ref-24481

---
many of the rules seemed to follow a more emotional logic about avoiding disgust. — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=339) ^ref-52004

---
There must be more to moral development than kids constructing rules as they take the perspectives of other people and feel their pain. There must be something beyond rationalism. — location: [352](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=352) ^ref-62712

---
all societies must resolve a small set of questions about how to order society, the most important being how to balance the needs of individuals and groups. — location: [365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=365) ^ref-46333

---
Most societies have chosen the sociocentric answer, placing the needs of groups and institutions first, and subordinating the needs of individuals. — location: [366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=366) ^ref-21866

---
In contrast, the individualistic answer places individuals at the center and makes society a servant of the individual. — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=367) ^ref-60307

---
the individualistic answer became a powerful rival during the Enlightenment. — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=369) ^ref-39693

---
people in some of the stories obviously hurt other people or treated them unfairly, and subjects (the people being interviewed) in both countries condemned these actions by saying that they were wrong, unalterably wrong, and universally wrong. — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=382) ^ref-35330

---
But the Indians would not condemn other cases that seemed (to Americans) just as clearly to involve harm and unfairness (see middle third). — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=384) ^ref-8651

---
Indian practices related to food, sex, clothing, and gender relations were almost always judged to be moral issues, not social conventions, — location: [389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=389) ^ref-22903

---
Children were not figuring out morality for themselves, based on the bedrock certainty that harm is bad. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=393) ^ref-35230

---
as a widow eating fish, and Americans predictably said that those cases were fine. But more important, they didn’t see these behaviors as social conventions that could be changed by popular consent. — location: [410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=410) ^ref-21412

---
if there’s some other country where people try to limit widows’ freedoms, well, they’re wrong to do so. — location: [412](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=412) ^ref-22275

---
social order is a moral order, but it’s an individualistic order built up around the protection of individuals and their freedom. — location: [413](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=413) ^ref-14484

---
When you put individuals first, before society, then any rule or social practice that limits personal freedom can be questioned. If it doesn’t protect — location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=416) ^ref-52620

---
somebody from harm, then it can’t be morally justified. It’s just a social convention. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=417) ^ref-52467

---
Turiel argued that once you take into account Indian “informational assumptions” about the way the world works, you see that most of Shweder’s thirty-nine stories really were moral violations, harming victims in ways that Americans could not see. — location: [422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=422) ^ref-21367

---
If you want to give people a quick flash of revulsion but deprive them of any victim they can use to justify moral condemnation, ask them about people who do disgusting or disrespectful things, but make sure the actions are done in private so that nobody else is offended. — location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=438) ^ref-50754

---
First, all four of my Philadelphia groups confirmed Turiel’s finding that Americans make a big distinction between moral and conventional violations. — location: [476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=476) ^ref-30678

---
the working-class Brazilian kids usually thought that it was wrong, and universally wrong, to break the social convention and not wear the uniform. — location: [480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=480) ^ref-50937

---
In Recife in particular, the working-class kids judged the uniform rebel in exactly the same way they judged the swing-pusher. — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=481) ^ref-35468

---
Unexpectedly, the effect of social class was much larger than the effect of city. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=487) ^ref-3745

---
In other words, well-educated people in all three cities were more similar to each other than they were to their lower-class neighbors. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=487) ^ref-26578

---
This was very strong support for Shweder’s claim that the moral domain goes far beyond harm. Most of my subjects said that the harmless-taboo violations were universally wrong even though they harmed nobody. — location: [493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=493) ^ref-54366

---
Note the skill and persistence of the interviewer, who probes for a deeper answer by changing the transgression to remove the punisher. — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=515) ^ref-45431

---
The biggest surprise was that so many subjects tried to invent victims. I — location: [522](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=522) ^ref-37977

---
in 38 percent of the 1,620 times that people heard a harmless-offensive story, they claimed that somebody was harmed. — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=523) ^ref-12456

---
Were people really condemning the actions because they foresaw these harms, or was it the reverse process—were people inventing these harms because they had already condemned the actions? — location: [526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=526) ^ref-60381

---
People usually condemned the actions very quickly—they didn’t seem to need much time to decide what they thought. But it often took them a while to come up with a victim, and they usually offered those victims up halfheartedly and almost apologetically. — location: [528](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=528) ^ref-36430

---
Yet even when subjects recognized that their victim claims were bogus, they still refused to say that the act was OK. Instead, they kept searching for another victim. — location: [536](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=536) ^ref-47698

---
They seemed to be morally dumbfounded—rendered speechless by their inability to explain verbally what they knew intuitively.29 — location: [538](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=538) ^ref-39798

---
They were working quite hard at reasoning. But it was not reasoning in search of truth; it was reasoning in support of their emotional reactions. — location: [540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=540) ^ref-24802

---
when a group of people make something sacred, the members of the cult lose the ability to think clearly about it. — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=597) ^ref-61500

---
Darwin offered several explanations for how morality could have evolved, and many of them pointed to emotions such as sympathy, which he thought was the “foundation-stone” of the social instincts. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=631) ^ref-55214

---
“social Darwinism”—the idea (raised but not endorsed by Darwin) that the richest and most successful nations, races, and individuals are the fittest. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=636) ^ref-46585

if Hitler was a nativist, then all nativists were Nazis. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=639) ^ref-39592

If evolution gave men and women different sets of desires and skills, for example, that would be an obstacle to achieving gender equality in many professions. — location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=642) ^ref-44924

So Hume’s model fit these cases best: when the master (passions) drops dead, the servant (reasoning) has neither the ability nor the desire to keep the estate running. Everything goes to ruin. — location: [702](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=702) ^ref-35501

Scott was not able to get them to abandon principles such as “Life is more important than property.” — location: [738](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=738) ^ref-2132

---
it’s obvious that people were making a moral judgment immediately and emotionally. Reasoning was merely the servant of the passions, — location: [799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=799) ^ref-33622

---
Moral reasoning was mostly just a post hoc search for reasons to justify the judgments people had already made. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=803) ^ref-63096

---
Given the judgments (themselves produced by the non-conscious cognitive machinery in the brain, sometimes correctly, sometimes not so), human beings produce rationales they believe account for their judgments. But the rationales (on this argument) are only ex post rationalizations.33 — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=831) ^ref-44585

“Reasoning-why” can occur only for creatures that have language and a need to explain themselves to other creatures. — location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=846) ^ref-48793

---
Not wanting to drink roach-tainted juice isn’t a moral judgment, it’s a personal preference. — location: [858](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=858) ^ref-16472

---
Yet moral judgments are not subjective statements; they are claims that somebody did something wrong. — location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=859) ^ref-25404

---
We do moral reasoning not to reconstruct the actual reasons why we ourselves came to a judgment; we reason to find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgment.36 — location: [861](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=861) ^ref-27302

---
Yet friends can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves: they can challenge us, giving us reasons and arguments (link 3) that sometimes trigger new intuitions, thereby making it possible for us to change our minds. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=915) ^ref-62713

“begin in a friendly way,” to “smile,” to “be a good listener,” and to “never say ‘you’re wrong.’ ” The persuader’s goal should be to convey respect, warmth, and an openness to dialogue — location: [940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=940) ^ref-14970

there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from their angle as well as your own.”50 — location: [946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=946) ^ref-9094

no matter how good our logic, it’s not going to change the minds of our opponents if they are in combat mode too. — location: [950](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=950) ^ref-61812

Roughly one in a hundred men (and many fewer women) are psychopaths. — location: [1150](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1150) ^ref-49338

infants are born with some knowledge of physics and mechanics: they expect that objects will move according to Newton’s laws of motion, — location: [1181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1181) ^ref-57601

they found that infants come equipped with innate abilities to understand their social world as well. — location: [1186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1186) ^ref-37890

“the capacity to evaluate individuals on the basis of their social interactions is universal and unlearned.”37 — location: [1196](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1196) ^ref-37211

---
But these findings suggest that by six months of age, infants are watching how people behave toward other people, and they are developing a preference for those who are nice rather than those who are mean. — location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0052FF7YM&location=1198) ^ref-60726
