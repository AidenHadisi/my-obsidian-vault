Rather than flee into exile (which he had the chance to do), Socrates drank the poison without any hesitation. — location: [163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=163) ^ref-33271

---
“The unexamined life is not worth living.” Socrates believed that in order for a person to be wise, that individual must be able to understand himself. — location: [166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=166) ^ref-23746

he sought to understand the difference between acting good and being good. It — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=168) ^ref-9055

Once the other person provides his answer, Socrates would think of a scenario where his answer was not the case, — location: [177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=177) ^ref-30559

The soul, according to Plato, can be broken down into three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. — location: [218](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=218) ^ref-34731

---
Reason: This is the part of the soul responsible for thinking and understanding when something is true versus false, real versus not apparent, and making rational decisions. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=219) ^ref-48043

---
Spirit: This is the part of the soul responsible for all desires that want victory and honor. — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=220) ^ref-63347

---
Appetite: This is the part of the soul where very basic cravings and desires come from. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=222) ^ref-13026

Now, because these prisoners have never been exposed to the actual objects and all their lives they have only witnessed the shadows, they mistake these shadows for reality. — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=247) ^ref-28420

---
The echoes of the cave, to them, are noises created by the shadows. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=249) ^ref-10705

---
If a shadow of a book were to appear, for example, these prisoners would claim that they have seen a book. They are not saying this is a shadow of a book, because their reality doesn’t know shadows. — location: [249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=249) ^ref-15086

---
To the prisoner, a book is the shadow that was cast on the wall. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=253) ^ref-48074

---
The illusion of a book seems more real than the book itself. — location: [253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=253) ^ref-24006

---
The prisoner would surely turn away from so much light and turn back to the dark shadows, which he holds to be more real. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=255) ^ref-15621

---
Now, what if this was taken one step further, and the prisoner was forced to go outside? The prisoner would be angry, distressed, and unable to see the reality before him because he would be so blinded by the light. — location: [256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=256) ^ref-30148

---
After a little while, however, the prisoner would adjust and understand that the reality in the cave was incorrect. — location: [261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=261) ^ref-38549

---
The prisoner would not look back at those days in the cave with fond memories, for he would now understand that his former perception was not actually reality. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=263) ^ref-57351

---
The freed prisoner then decides to return to the cave and set the others free. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=264) ^ref-25216

---
struggles to adjust to the darkness of the cave. The other prisoners find this behavior startling — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=265) ^ref-13437

---
and instead of offering praise, they find him to be stupid and will not believe what the freed prisoner has to say. The prisoners threaten to kill the freed prisoner if he sets them free. — location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=266) ^ref-4369

---
People mistake the appearance of what is in front of them as reality and live in ignorance (and quite happily, for ignorance is all these people know). However, — location: [269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=269) ^ref-6684

In essence, knowledge gained through the senses and perception is not knowledge at all, but opinion. It is only through philosophical reasoning that one is able to pursue knowledge. — location: [277](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=277) ^ref-59448

While justification is present, the justification is fallible because there is the possibility that the belief could end up being false. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=513) ^ref-33974

---
Hume takes on the notion of God’s existence, divine creation, and the soul. According to Hume, since people cannot experience or get an impression from God, divine creation, or the soul, there is no real reason to believe in their existence. — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=550) ^ref-60766

This is the principle that truths can be separated into two types. One type of truth states that once ideas (such as a true statement in math) are proven, they remain proven. The other truth relates to matters of fact and things that occur in the world. — location: [556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=556) ^ref-61793

If a group of people act rationally, they will actually do far worse than if a group of people acted irrationally. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=659) ^ref-57275

---
Essentially, these examples prove that pursuing one’s own self-interest and gratification will actually turn out to be self-defeating in the long run. — location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=674) ^ref-56336

---
Thomas Aquinas brought faith and reasoning together. — location: [694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=694) ^ref-8417

He believed that knowledge, whether obtained through nature or through religious studies, all came from God and could work together. — location: [694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=694) ^ref-54852

Anything that is in motion was put in motion by something else that was in motion. — location: [708](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=708) ^ref-21332

this cannot infinitely keep going backward because there would never be an original mover — location: [709](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=709) ^ref-55934

---
So there must be an unmoved mover that is first, and that is understood to be God. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=710) ^ref-62103

Everything is caused by something, and nothing can be caused by itself. — location: [712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=712) ^ref-52237

We observe in nature that things come to exist and then cease to exist. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=716) ^ref-45061

everything that exists needs to come from something that exists, and if it is possible for something to not exist, then it wouldn’t exist before, and it wouldn’t exist now. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=716) ^ref-15602

this perfection or maximum is understood to be God. — location: [722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=722) ^ref-9230

Though unaware, these objects are clearly acting toward a purpose according to a specific plan, and therefore, there must be a being guiding them that has the knowledge to direct them toward their purpose. This is understood to be God. — location: [725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=725) ^ref-8482

Aquinas believed the highest end was eternal blessedness, which was achieved by a union with God in the afterlife. — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=732) ^ref-34534

---
Because eternal happiness is a union with God, there is only an imperfect happiness in this life since we can never know everything there is to know about God in this life. — location: [735](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=735) ^ref-21246

Hard determinism is the philosophical theory that, because every event has a cause, all human action is predetermined and therefore choices made by free will do not exist. — location: [742](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=742) ^ref-2582

The Principle of Universal Causation: This — location: [747](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=747) ^ref-38942

---
The Principle of Avoidability and Freedom: If a person acts freely, then he could have done something other than what he in fact did. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=749) ^ref-45870

---
Yet, if no one could have done anything other than what he in fact did, then no one ever acts freely. — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=750) ^ref-40402

Auxiliary Principle: This asserts that if every event has a cause, then no one could have done anything other than what he in fact did. — location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=751) ^ref-6176

Consequentialism is the philosophical view that an action is morally right when it produces the best overall consequences. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=895) ^ref-40035

---
An act is right or wrong based solely on its results. The more good consequences created from an act, the better and more right that act is. — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=897) ^ref-9899

---
However, another type of utilitarianism claims that since something morally wrong is already happening, participating by pulling the lever would also be morally wrong because you are now partially responsible for the death of a person or persons, whereas before, you were not. — location: [906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=906) ^ref-64607

---
introduced by Thomas Aquinas, is the notion that an action can be morally permissible even when one of the consequences is morally bad. — location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=912) ^ref-33766

---
There must be intention for the good consequence. — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=917) ^ref-24682

---
The action itself must be morally neutral or good, and never morally wrong. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=919) ^ref-37072

---
The good consequence must be the direct result of the action, and not the result of the bad consequence. — location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=920) ^ref-8443

---
The bad consequence can never outweigh the good consequence. — location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=922) ^ref-40326

according to realism, a red apple and a red cherry have a universal essence of “redness.” — location: [935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=935) ^ref-9323

Realists claim that the property “redness” does, in fact, exist even if there are no minds to perceive it. — location: [936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=936) ^ref-53481

Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. — location: [1229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1229) ^ref-52516

---
unlike Kant, Hegel believed these ideas were social, meaning they are completely shaped by other people’s ideas. — location: [1294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1294) ^ref-40690

---
Through the use of a common language, traditions of one’s society, and the religious and cultural institutions that one belongs to, an individual’s mind is shaped. — location: [1294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1294) ^ref-21419

---
This collective consciousness of a society, which Hegel refers to as “Spirit,” is responsible for shaping one’s consciousness and ideas. — location: [1296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1296) ^ref-43485

---
Hegel adds to this theory by stating that self-consciousness not only involves an object and a subject; it also involves other subjects because individuals truly become aware of themselves when someone else is watching. — location: [1305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1305) ^ref-56638

On the night of November 10, 1619, Descartes had three dreams, or visions, that would change the course of his life and philosophy. — location: [1329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1329) ^ref-25123

For thoughts to exist, there must be a source to do the thinking; therefore if one thinks, one has to exist. — location: [1348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1348) ^ref-58134

Therefore, reason and thought are the essence of all people. — location: [1356](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1356) ^ref-39428

Therefore, Descartes concludes that the only way to have knowledge of other things is by having knowledge of God. — location: [1360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1360) ^ref-59864

Descartes believed the rational mind was in control of the body, but that the body could influence the mind to act irrationally, such as when one performs an act of passion. — location: [1366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00EKPKRPO&location=1366) ^ref-37192
