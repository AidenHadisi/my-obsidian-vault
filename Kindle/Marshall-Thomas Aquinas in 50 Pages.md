## Highlights
The writings of Aristotle were often accompanied by commentaries—commentaries written by Muslims and Jews. — location: [72](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=72) ^ref-348

---
The Averroists pitted reason against faith. Thomas wished to show that right reason never conflicted with the true faith. Averroism — location: [117](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=117) ^ref-46956

---
Philosophy regards natural knowledge; theology regards supernatural knowledge. — location: [159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=159) ^ref-56718

---
Philosophy is the body of knowledge that we can know by reason. Theology is the body of knowledge that we can know by divine revelation. — location: [164](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=164) ^ref-2041

---
unrelated. Thomas Aquinas did not see it this way. Thomas held the two disciplines as distinct, but not divided and certainly not contradictory. — location: [168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=168) ^ref-54380

---
means that the power of reason and the truths known through reason are able to aid and assist men in theology. — location: [169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=169) ^ref-24419

---
Thomas holds that a pagan living on an island in the middle of nowhere can know the truth that God exists. — location: [172](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=172) ^ref-11147

---
Now, Thomas also holds that there are truths that can never be known by reason, but are nevertheless true. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=180) ^ref-44021

---
He grants that the Trinity cannot be known by reason alone. — location: [182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=182) ^ref-48333

---
philosophical truths as “preambles of faith” (praeambula fidei). — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=197) ^ref-9755

---
Thus, the “preambles of faith” are those things that “walk or go before faith.” — location: [200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=200) ^ref-42294

---
A pagan can know there is a God and know that he has an immortal soul long before he becomes a Christian. — location: [202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=202) ^ref-3186

---
For Thomas, this could not be true since God is the author of both columns—philosophical truths and theological truths. — location: [208](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=208) ^ref-28216

---
“grace perfects nature.” — location: [210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=210) ^ref-1892

---
Philosophy and theology, like reason and faith, are complementary — location: [220](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=220) ^ref-30849

---
because God is the author of both. — location: [221](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=221) ^ref-33086

---
Philosophy pertains to reason alone. Theology pertains to divine revelation. — location: [223](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=223) ^ref-22580

---
For Thomas, the highest “science” is theology, or the study of God’s revelation to man. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=235) ^ref-61624

---
Thomas Aquinas holds that all physical things consist of form and matter. Form is the idea, and matter is the stuff. — location: [275](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=275) ^ref-28755

---
Thomas quotes Aristotle, saying that the intellect is at first “like a clean tablet on which nothing is written.”[iii] — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=320) ^ref-41004

---
When we are conceived, our intellect has the potential to know things, but it does not yet know things. — location: [321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=321) ^ref-26553

---
This is why Thomas claims the intellect has potential. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=322) ^ref-62532

---
intellect is what Thomas calls “pure act” since God is fully actualized and lacking nothing. God knows everything. He is never surprised. — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=323) ^ref-58904

---
Thomas Aquinas wanted to insist that each person has his own active intellect. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=359) ^ref-45110

---
is necessary for these differences [namely, the passive and active intellect] to be in the soul.”[v] — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=360) ^ref-44678

---
Philosophy only asks whether God exists. It cannot answer questions such as “Who is God and what is his plan for me?” — location: [366](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=366) ^ref-44125

---
Notably, Thomas believes that the existence of God is not self-evident. He does not think that God’s existence is known immediately. Rather, one must — location: [369](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=369) ^ref-4498

---
reason to the conclusion that God exists. This is an important distinction. God’s existence is not self-evident, but it can be demonstrated logically. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=371) ^ref-64602

---
The first way holds that since all things are in motion, there must be something that is the first “unmoved mover,” which we call God. — location: [383](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=383) ^ref-60433

---
The second way holds that since we all experience the principle of cause and effect, there — location: [385](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=385) ^ref-22777

---
must be an initial first cause, which we call God. — location: [386](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=386) ^ref-4306

---
Therefore, there must be “something” that is not contingent and is responsible for the existence of all contingent things. — location: [390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=390) ^ref-24049

---
Thomas says that the atheist is not a logical man because he refuses to acknowledge what is demonstrable. — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=481) ^ref-48610

---
The atheist denies the existence of God for moral reasons, not for philosophical reasons. — location: [482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=482) ^ref-20541

---
We can also ask, would the Unmoved Mover who is God ever change? This cannot be the case, because if he changed then he would have been moved or caused and this conflicts with what has already been established. — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=513) ^ref-3758

---
this work, Thomas distinguishes knowing “that” there is a God and knowing “what” God is. — location: [524](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=524) ^ref-60411

---
Plato’s disciple Aristotle simply assumed that it was absolutely impossible to have a knowledgeable relationship with the Unmoved Mover of the universe. — location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=533) ^ref-408

---
If Ulric the Univocal heard someone say, “God is my Father,” he assumes the term “God” and “my father” are one and the same. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=562) ^ref-45064

---
If Ulric the Univocal understood you univocally, then when he met your father he would address him as “God.” That’s a big problem. — location: [562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=562) ^ref-60029

---
When your mom says, ‘God is my rock,’ she means it by way of analogy. She means God is like a rock. God is strong. When someone says, ‘You’re a pain in the neck,’ what he means is you are like a pain in the neck. Literally speaking, it is false. You are not in his neck. But analogically, it is — location: [581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=581) ^ref-3421

---
true. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=584) ^ref-27119

---
is true that anything we say about God is not fully accurate. If I say, “God is perfect,” then Ezekiel the Equivocal is going to interrupt and say my finite and human notion of “perfection” is insufficient in describing God’s perfection. — location: [588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=588) ^ref-6456

---
According to Thomas Aquinas, God is existence and everything else exists in God. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=616) ^ref-65458

---
ocean exists because it shares in God’s existence. This, — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=616) ^ref-27728

---
is how Thomas explains it:   Hence from the knowledge of sensible things the whole power of God cannot be known; — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=650) ^ref-58873

---
To be strict, then, we can know absolutely nothing about God because God is beyond the senses. — location: [655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=655) ^ref-24376

---
No, God cannot improve. — location: [681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=681) ^ref-31070

---
we know that God is the Unmoved Mover. Since God does not move, he is not here and then later there. He does not move from location to location. Rather, since he is the efficient cause, he is present always and everywhere. — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=696) ^ref-62945

---
Our intellect, like a trained charioteer, is supposed to govern our passions through the reign of the will. If we let go of our will, we lose control and our passions take over. — location: [941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=941) ^ref-26510

---
the passions considered by themselves are not good or evil. However, if the passions are considered as subject to the intellect and will, the passions can be judged as morally good or evil.[xviii] — location: [1000](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1000) ^ref-30246

---
passions with regard to children. According to Thomas Aquinas, children are ruled by their passions until they attain to the age of reason. At the age of reason, the child’s intellect and will are developed enough to function. — location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1004) ^ref-42632

---
Thomas Aquinas say that this occurs in the human soul around seven years of age. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1005) ^ref-11922

---
The passions can be good if they are submitted to — location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1016) ^ref-50169

---
“Virtue is a good quality of the mind by which we live righteously, of which no one can make bad use, which God works in us, without us.”[xx] — location: [1044](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1044) ^ref-30202

---
Simply stated, virtues are good patterns or habits. — location: [1056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1056) ^ref-19504

---
Virtues, then, are good patterns and vices are evil patterns. — location: [1060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1060) ^ref-62837

---
Prudence is the habit of proper decision making. — location: [1089](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1089) ^ref-20428

---
brief, justice is giving each person his due. This — location: [1101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1101) ^ref-58413

---
be a just person entails being fair in all your dealings and being grateful to your benefactors. If someone does a job for you, you pay him the right amount. If you rent a house, you pay on time. If you receive a loan, you pay — location: [1103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1103) ^ref-13558

---
Thomas also states that justice requires us to be friendly and generous with others.[xxvii] — location: [1105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1105) ^ref-28578

---
we brag about ourselves, we are giving undue attention to ourselves—a sin against justice. — location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1107) ^ref-41073

---
Fortitude is the virtue that perfects our irascible appetites. — location: [1109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1109) ^ref-47287

---
Thomas Aquinas sees martyrdom as the greatest act of fortitude since martyrdom overcomes the fear of death itself for the sake of man’s final goal—God. — location: [1110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1110) ^ref-51290

---
A person with the virtue of fortitude is courageous. He is strong but not prideful. — location: [1116](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1116) ^ref-50383

---
The virtue of temperance is that habit that perfects the concupiscible desires for food, drink, and sex. Aristotle — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1119) ^ref-39487

---
Thomas Aquinas says that sins against temperance are the most disgraceful sins since they make us most like the irrational beasts.[xxx] — location: [1121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1121) ^ref-31211

---
However, Thomas Aquinas holds that there are three supernatural virtues that exceed man’s natural capacities: faith, hope, and charity. — location: [1129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1129) ^ref-22781

---
Faith is the belief or trust in all the teachings of Jesus Christ given to the Twelve Apostles. — location: [1134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1134) ^ref-12021

---
Hope is the second theological virtue and its object is everlasting happiness. — location: [1161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1161) ^ref-50783

---
However, it is another thing to believe that this sacrifice applies to me personally and that I might attain the eternal happiness of Heaven. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1162) ^ref-10265

---
This personal application of the faith is the virtue of hope. One — location: [1163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1163) ^ref-21238

---
The virtue of charity leads us to love God and others. — location: [1168](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1168) ^ref-54966

---
Such a person, says Thomas Aquinas, will not go to Heaven since faith must be formed by love.[xxxiii] — location: [1173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1173) ^ref-11780

---
Natural law is an inward inclination toward the good and away from evil. — location: [1225](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1225) ^ref-62095

---
Eternal law is the divine governance of all created things. — location: [1229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1229) ^ref-5321

---
Although natural law can never be suppressed in any human, as Thomas teaches, the emerging precepts can be confused and erased. — location: [1241](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1241) ^ref-44947

---
This is one of the several reasons why natural law, by itself, is never enough. — location: [1245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00P8AXWV6&location=1245) ^ref-59314
