• Functions — location: [1848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1848) ^ref-61955

---
Perhaps the most important feature in C++ is the class, which lets programmers define their own types. — location: [1859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1859) ^ref-39053

---
Types determine the meaning of the data and operations in our programs. — location: [1887](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1887) ^ref-47481

---
C++ defines a set of primitive types that include the arithmetic types and a special type named void. — location: [1895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1895) ^ref-1468

---
The void type has no associated values and can be used in only a few circumstances, most commonly as the return type for functions that do not return a value. — location: [1898](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1898) ^ref-55801

---
The bool type represents the truth values true and false. — location: [1906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1906) ^ref-21603

---
char is the same size as a single machine byte. — location: [1911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1911) ^ref-6842

---
(Unicode is a standard for representing characters used in essentially any natural language.) — location: [1917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1917) ^ref-58827

---
The language guarantees that an int will be at least as large as short, a long at least as large as an int, and long long at least as large as long. — location: [1918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1918) ^ref-62233

---
the integral types may be signed or unsigned. — location: [1952](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1952) ^ref-64176

---
A signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero); an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero. — location: [1953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1953) ^ref-50003

---
The types int, short, long, and long long are all signed. — location: [1955](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1955) ^ref-58149

---
The type unsigned int may be abbreviated as unsigned. — location: [1958](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1958) ^ref-31140

---
char can hold the values from 0 through 255 inclusive. — location: [1967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1967) ^ref-5371

---
signed char is guaranteed to be able to hold values from –127 through 127; — location: [1969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1969) ^ref-43328

---
Use an unsigned type when you know that the values cannot be negative. — location: [1976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1976) ^ref-51183

---
Use int for integer arithmetic. short is usually too small and, in practice, long often has the same size as int. If your data values are larger than the minimum guaranteed size of an int, then use long long. — location: [1977](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1977) ^ref-46655

---
If you need a tiny integer, explicitly specify either signed char or unsigned char. — location: [1986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1986) ^ref-42914

---
Use double for floating-point computations; float usually does not have enough precision, — location: [1988](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=1988) ^ref-6111

---
Type conversions happen automatically when we use an object of one type where an object of another type is expected. — location: [2002](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2002) ^ref-3130

---
When we assign one of the nonbool arithmetic types to a bool object, the result is false if the value is 0 and true otherwise. — location: [2023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2023) ^ref-10876

---
When we assign a bool to one of the other arithmetic types, the resulting value is 1 if the bool is true and 0 if the bool is false. — location: [2027](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2027) ^ref-30858

---
When we assign a floating-point value to an object of integral type, the value is truncated. The value that is stored is the part before the decimal point. — location: [2032](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2032) ^ref-34931

---
If we assign an out-of-range value to an object of unsigned type, the result is the remainder of the value modulo the number of values the target type can hold. — location: [2035](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2035) ^ref-266

---
we assign an out-of-range value to an object of signed type, the result is undefined — location: [2040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2040) ^ref-18067

---
A value, such as 42, is known as a literal because its value self-evident. — location: [2149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0091I7FEQ&location=2149) ^ref-4832
