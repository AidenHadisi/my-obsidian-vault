## Highlights
The term encapsulation covers two closely related ideas: simplifying behavior and hiding data. — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=197) ^ref-13187

---
Encapsulating behavior by using abstractions is a powerful tool for making code more expressive, more testable, and easier to maintain. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=229) ^ref-37524

---
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=262) ^ref-13104

---
Abstractions should not depend on details. Instead, details should depend on abstractions. — location: [263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=263) ^ref-19936

---
High-level modules are the code that your organization really cares about. — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=264) ^ref-63426

---
The high-level modules of a software system are the functions, classes, and packages that deal with our real-world concepts. — location: [266](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=266) ^ref-60091

---
By contrast, low-level modules are the code that your organization doesn’t care about. It’s unlikely that your HR department gets excited about filesystems or network sockets. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=267) ^ref-16454

---
abstractions already: they’re simplified interfaces that encapsulate behavior, in the way that our duckduckgo module encapsulated a search engine’s API. — location: [272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=272) ^ref-51603

---
behavior should come first and drive our storage requirements. — location: [302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=302) ^ref-41900

---
The domain is a fancy way of saying the problem you’re trying to solve. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=332) ^ref-55979

---
A model is a map of a process or phenomenon that captures a useful property. — location: [336](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=336) ^ref-4053

---
The domain model is the mental map that business owners have of their businesses. All business people have these mental maps — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B085KB31X3&location=340) ^ref-9007
